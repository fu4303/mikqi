## Why?

Why i always change with another stack?

*  My first stack is just **React.js** use REST for get all blog post from my backend and after that i move. Why? Because i was struggle with workflow i made and bad UX when i need a new post. 
*  The next one is [**Hubpress**](https://github.com/HubPress/hubpress.io). I love this platfrom so much, an easy way jekyll blog in github pages with some admin pages and why i move again? The Maintainer is not maintenance it anymore. 
*  So i move to [**Hexo**](https://hexo.io/). It is easy to understand and easy to customize the template but i move again because when i move to another page it load new asset again so it needs so many cost if you're in slow internet connection.
*  And finally i move to [**Gatsby**](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). First impression with this stack is `amazing` so fast and the developer experience is so good. Maybe i'll stick to this so lets try.

## Intorduction

In this post, i will give you know about this site stack. From `this.rivki.id` and `blog.rivki.id`.

#### this.rivki.id

* [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org)
* [Velocity-Animation](http://velocityjs.org)
* [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)
* [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes) - ðŸ’™

So why i use **Nuxt** for my personal site? The answer is simple. Because i already familiar with that. Thats it. **Velocity Animation** is use for creating animation when you click Hamburger menu. And last i use **Skeleton** for grid and add some extra flexbox for layouting.

#### blog.rivki.id
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
* [Velocity-Animation](http://velocityjs.org)

I already answer why i use **Gatsby** in [here](#why) and in the explaination in domain *this.rivki.id*
